# Some informations

- I used React Redux with Redux Toolkit to manage states.
- CSS is vanilla. No library or preprocessor used.
- I added a loader on conversations and messages loading.
- I added an error message if the answer of fetching data is rejected.
- The logged user can be managed with getLoggedUserId() function.
- The logged user can select a conversation and create new messages.
- The logged user can create a new conversation by selecting another user from API (/users)
- I added functionnality to delete my own messages, but I have a 404 on the delete endpoint, and for now I didn't find the issue.
